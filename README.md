# Global-Development-Trends

📌 Overview
This project explores World Bank Development Indicators (WDI) for the years 2000–2025.
The focus is on understanding global patterns in:
🌱 CO₂ emissions (environment)
💰 GDP (economy)
🌐 Internet usage (digital growth)
🧑‍⚕️ Life expectancy (social well-being)

The analysis combines time-series trends, geographical comparisons, and cross-indicator relationships to evaluate sustainable development progress.
